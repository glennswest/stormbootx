# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### 2026-09-02
- **feat:** `tcp4probe`, a second UEFI binary (24 KB) that answers "will
  stormbootx run on this server model?" before anyone writes a stick (#5). It
  surveys the nine protocols of the network stack layer by layer, runs a
  `ConnectController` pass if TCP4 is missing, surveys again, then creates and
  configures a TCP4 child — because presence is necessary and not sufficient.
- **feat:** `stormbootx` binds the firmware's own layered network drivers before
  declaring `EFI_TCP4` absent (#5). Drivers that are built in but unbound are
  the likeliest cause on enterprise firmware and the fix for them is free; the
  console says which of the three ways TCP4 turned out to be reachable.
- **chore:** build is warning-free, so a new warning is visible as one.
- **fix:** the NVMe transfer size is derived from the path MTU rather than a
  hand-edited constant (#6). `EFI_TCP4.GetModeData` reports the link MTU; a
  jumbo path gets a command sized to one frame (8 KiB at MTU 9000) and every
  other path gets 64 KiB, which is faster where nothing aligns to a frame
  anyway because this client has no read pipelining. The chosen size and the
  MTU it came from are printed on the console.
- **docs:** project `CLAUDE.md` (build, module map, load-bearing facts, work plan)
  and this changelog.

## [v0.1.0] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- `stormbootx`, a UEFI NVMe/TCP boot extension: read the service tag out of
  SMBIOS, attach a remote image over `nvme-tcp://`, publish it as
  `EFI_BLOCK_IO_PROTOCOL` and let the firmware boot it.
- `smbios.rs` — SMBIOS type 1 serial number, read with no network.
- `tcp4.rs` — a blocking socket over `EFI_TCP4_PROTOCOL`.
- `nvme.rs` — NVMe/TCP initiator: ICReq/ICResp, Fabrics Connect, admin and I/O
  queues, R2T/H2CData writes.
- `blockio.rs` — install `EFI_BLOCK_IO_PROTOCOL` and `ConnectController`.
- `registry.rs` — claim an image from sbregistry over plain HTTP on TCP4.
- `config.rs` — read the target from `\stormboot\stormboot.conf` on the volume
  found via `EFI_LOADED_IMAGE_PROTOCOL`.
- `scripts/build-boot-agent.sh` — build the GPT/ESP boot image.
